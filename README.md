- Zod

## FAQ

### Q: Why does the site look... like that?
**A:** I wanted frank's eyes to hurt after a frolf session :)

### Q: How can I get whitelisted to check out the production version?
**A:** idk why you would but email me at email@bryercowan.com.

### Q: Why are you whitelisting?
**A:** protect the db from the world. I don't want to wake up to a billion dollar charge from vercel...
